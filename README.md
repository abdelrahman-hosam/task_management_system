# task_management_system
A task management system that I made as one of my personal projects in order to improve my skills and get hands-on experience 

Task management system consists of 4 roles:
1- Admin (has the premission to create, delete, update, and get the data about the other roles but it does not have premission to do what other roles should do)
2- Head manager (creates tasks and assigns them to a team that he has premission to assign tasks to sets deadline and extends it remove or update the tasks besides some functions that act as helpers as get assigned tasks)
3- Team leader (views the assigned tasks to the team and assigns them to members besides other functions)
4- Team member (views the assigned tasks from the team leader and updates the progress)

--Database--
This system was made by a combination of sql and nosql databases that could add effeciency, flexibility and enhance speed as the sql database was use with the static data or the data that has relations while the nosql was used with the dynamic data (like: arrays, dictionaries and so on) this combination made the system respond with higher speed, better performance and powerful management of data

--note--
some functions in the system are not tested yet
